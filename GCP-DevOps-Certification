After working for 3 years in Azure I decided to attempt to learn GCP six months ago. Opted for GCP DevOps Certifcation as it suits my profile.
Here is what i learnt:
1. Break each tool into the following
a. How do you install
b. How do you configure CI/CD
c. What kind of code resides in these tools
d. Monitoring
2. Use the Google CloudSkill Boost and Google Code Labs extensively
3. Refrence Blogs when you find Google Documentation tideous
4. Be aware of various CI/CD stages and tools used like Jenkins, Spinnaker etc

If you are Azure aware checkout out https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/72
For AWS folks,  https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/71  would be a good starting point.

Below are the links to the Study Material i used









GoodLuck!
